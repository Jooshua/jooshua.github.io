I spent the practical terms of my dual bachelor studies working with aircraft noise data at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in GÃ¶ttingen.

**Data preparation and visualization:** 
In year one I collected and formatted data to later visualize it via generating a PDF with LaTeX and Matplotlib. -> LaTeX, Matplotlib, Python

**Integration of expert tools into a distributed software framework:** In year two I integrated expert tools for aircraft noise prediction into the distributed DLR software framework RCE. The in and outputs of the expert tools were formatted to CPACS (a XML format for aircrafts) using Python. -> CPACS, RCE Python

**Speedup input-data generation using parallel programming:**
In year three I investigated the increase in performance of the generation of input data for aircraft noise scenarios through parallel programming.

**Data Evaluation and Interactive Visualization (Thesis):** In my thesis I automated the generation of data to compare aircraft noise measurements with calculated aircraft noise. Afterwards interactive visualization of that data using Bokeh was realized.
