I spent the semesters of my dual bachelor's programme working on different topics at the DHBW Mannheim.

**UWP Application:** 
To practise software development in a small group, we used C#. We developed a UWP application to visualize server data, e.g. on a HoloLens.

**Unity Game "Space Poller":** 
A C# twin stick shooter we developed in Unity and available on [itch.io](https://lilium-games.itch.io/space-poller).

**Project "VoiceLED":** 
A voice-controlled LED display panel that can be controlled by an iOS app via Bluetooth Low Energy. 
I programmed the microcontroller (STM32) in C.
