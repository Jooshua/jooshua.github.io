During my master studies I worked part-time on the open source [VirtualSatellite](https://github.com/virtualsatellite) software at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Brunswick.
Virtual Satellite is a Java / Eclipse / EMF application for model-based systems engineering.

**FreeCAD Module for Virtual Satellite:**
I have developed a [Python module](https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-FreeCAD-mod) for the FreeCAD CAD software.
It can be used to display and modify visualizations of Virtual Satellite by transferring JSON data.

**REST API for Virtual Satellite:**
I then developed a REST API for the headless version of [VirtualSatellite Core](https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-Core) build upon Jersey.
This API is also used in the FreeCAD module.
