During my master studies I was working part time on the open source [VirtualSatellite](https://github.com/virtualsatellite) software at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Brunswick.
TBD what is virsat, which tech stack

**FreeCAD Module for Virtual Satellite:** 
I developed a [Python module](https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-FreeCAD-mod) for the CAD software FreeCAD. It can be used to display and modify visualizations of Virtual Satellite by transferring JSON data. -> FreeCAD, Python

**REST API for Virtual Satellite:** I then developed a REST API for [VirtualSatellite Core](https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-Core) to start Virtual Satellite headless and provide a universal API to communicate with VirtualSatellite, which is also used in the FreeCAD Module. -> EMF, Eclipse IDE, Jersey, REST, Virtual Satellite Core
