Industrial applications of quantum computing were investigated in the QuBRA project.
We investigated how optimization problems of the software product line domain could be adressed using quantum computing in {% cite DBLP:conf/icse-qse/AmmermannBESS23 %} and {% cite DBLP:conf/icse-qse/AmmermannBBS24 %}.
