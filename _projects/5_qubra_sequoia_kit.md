Industrial applications of quantum computing have been investigated in the Quantum Methods and Benchmarks for Resource Allocation (QuBRA) project.
The SEQUOIA end-to-end project is working towards high-performance, automated and controllable end-to-end solutions for industrial applications.
In this context, we have investigated in {% cite DBLP:conf/icse-qse/AmmermannBESS23 %} and {% cite DBLP:conf/icse-qse/AmmermannBBS24 %} how software product line optimisation problems could be addressed using quantum computing.
