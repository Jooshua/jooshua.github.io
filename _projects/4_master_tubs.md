I spent the semesters of my Master's degree working on different topics at the ISF at TUBS.

**e4CompareFramework frontend:**
The project explorer of the Eclipse / Java [e4CompareFramework](https://github.com/KamilRosiak/e4CompareFramework) has been migrated from SWT to JavaFX.

**Evaluation of variablilty- and taxonomy mining:** 
Using Xtend code clone analysis tools were automatically evaluated against a ground truth generated by the e4CompareFramework clone generator.

**An Architecture Information Query Language for the Digital Architecture Twin (Thesis):**
In my thesis, I developed an Architecture Information Query Language (AIQL) that allows users to query the Digital Architecture Twin (DArT) for such stakeholder-tailored architecture information using the Xtext language workbench and the Epsilon Object Language (EOL).
The results have been published in a paper {% cite DBLP:conf/ecsa/AmmermannJLS23 %}.
