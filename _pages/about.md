I'm Joshua Ammermann, a German software engineer in my twenties.

For my Bachelor's degree, I completed a dual study programme at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in GÃ¶ttingen. In October 2019, I received my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from the DHBW Mannheim.

Until April 2022, I studied at the Technical University of Braunschweig (TUBS) and worked part-time at the DLR in Brunswick. In April 2022 I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from TUBS.

Since then, I have been working as a doctoral researcher at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). You can find a list of my scientific publications [here](/publications/).

I have already gained some practical experience through work, studies and private projects. But I still enjoy mastering new technologies, like this website. My most interesting projects can be found [here](/projects/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
