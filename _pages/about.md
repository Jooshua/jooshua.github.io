I'm Joshua Ammermann, a German software engineer in my twenties.

For my Bachelor's degree, I completed a dual study programme at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in GÃ¶ttingen. In October 2019, I received my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from the DHBW Mannheim.

Until April 2022, I studied at the Technical University of Braunschweig (TUBS) and worked part-time at the DLR in Brunswick. In April 2022 I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from TUBS.

Since then, I have been working as a doctoral researcher at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). A list of my scientific publications can be found [here](/publications/).

I have already gained some practical experience through work, studies and private projects. But I still enjoy mastering new technologies, like this website. My most interesting projects can be found [here](/projects/).
