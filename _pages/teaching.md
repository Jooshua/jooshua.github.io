At KIT, my teaching activities mainly involve student projects, organising lectures and carrying out the practical part of a lecture.

I was involved in:
- Programming paradigms - compilers (WS24)
- Introduction to quantum computing (WS23)
- Software engineering I (SS23, SS24, SS25)
- Practice of software development (WS22, WS23)

I have also (co-)supervised 4 theses so far.
